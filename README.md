<h1>Useful tools for linux</h1>
<p>So, i hope you are fine, that's my first time writing in other language for an project that's beggining, i'am do this that way beacuse i know the most content for linux is written in english.</p>
<p>I won't review this text on translate or other thing, than can be several mistakes in my writing, previously i'm sorry i hope these scripts help you in something</p>

<p>I still don't know how programs in linux are configured, but i'm learing many things in my new jobs, however i started meaning how can i solve some problems and first problem occurred with me it was to list failed services on linux, It's oblivious we could use
something how "systemctl status service_name.service" but i belive that quick view as a whole help a lot</p>
